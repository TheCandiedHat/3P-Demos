# 3P: Project Puzzle Place [DEMO]
## Free Demos!

Hello everyone, Candied Hat here from (CandiedCoding)[https://twitter.com/CandiedCoders]! Head over to the releases for demo downloads!

### So what is 3P?
3P is a platformer and puzzle game. It is inspired by Undertale (dialogue), FNAF (ugly minigames), and Please Don't Touch Anything (button puzzles). So, it's pretty much what happens when you turn FNAF into a puzzle game, with funny dialogue. I think that's about it...
